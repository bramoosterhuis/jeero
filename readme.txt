= Is your ticketings solution missing? =
My objective is to offer imports from _any_ ticketing solution to _any_ calendar plugin. [Contact me](mailto:jeroen@slimndap.com), so I can add your solution as well.

= Get started for free =
Jeero is a subscription based service, provided by [Slim & Dapper](https://slimndap.com). You can easily setup a free subscription inside the plugin. The free subscription is fully functional and lets you sync up to 10 upcoming events at any given time. When you are ready to move ahead you can upgrade to one of the paid plans. 


== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins -> Add New and look for 'Jeero'.
2. Install and activate the Jeero plugin.
3. Go to Jeero in the WordPress admin and click on ‘Add subscription’.
4. Select your ticketing solution and your calendar plugin and submit the form.
5. Fill in the missing fields in the form. Submit the form.

Wait a couple of minutes (max 5) and go to your Calendar plugin.

You should see the first 10 upcoming events that coming from your ticketing solutions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I upgrade? =

I am still working on the subscription engine. Once it ready the possibility to upgrade will be made available inside the plugin. It shouldn't take long.

= How much will it cost? =

Subscription rates will range from €20 - €30 per month, depending on your total number of events.
